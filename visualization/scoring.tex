\section*{Performance Score Calculation}

\subsection*{Performance Loss Calculation}
For each metric:
\[
L_{metric} = \frac{baseline_{metric} - current_{metric}}{baseline_{metric}}
\]
where \( metric \) is each of object accuracy (obj), relation accuracy (rel), and triplet accuracy (triplet).

\subsection*{Differential Calculation}
The differential for each metric is calculated as:
\[
D_{metric} = L_{metric, i+1} - L_{metric, i}
\]

\subsection*{Score Calculation Including Weights}
The score incorporating weights for each metric is calculated by:
\[
S = \sum_{metric \in \{obj, rel, triplet\}} w_{metric} \cdot (|L_{metric}| - |D_{metric}|)
\]
where \( w_{metric} \) represents the weight for each metric.
